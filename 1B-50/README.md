# 1B-50 | FROM TRASH TO TREASURE

We cannot emphasis how much sensitive information can be left on papers when we dispose of used printed materials. That is why it advisable for organizations to do proper thrash management of paper documents as sensitive information could be exposed to threat actors through a social engineering technique named dumpster driving.

On this research, our team reached out to use this technique and, in the process, we laid our hands on some sensitive information pointing out weaknesses on the 1B-50 digital asset. In this case of 1B-50, they have done their best to keep the sensitive information on the paper out of sight for non-technical individuals, but technical people can easily decipher what they are hiding.

We don’t want to believe where the information we found is pointing to as it generally exposes personally identifiable information of all registration done by 1B-50, so we have to confirm this hypothesis not to be an error on that single sample by getting more sample data from our research data where all proved to be true.

In the course of our research, our finding was able to guess the reason why 1B-50 initially hid the information on the document for all registrants. It is to serve as a means of confirming the bearer’s registration on their system. If secure coding practice has been put into use when building the registration platform of 1B-50, such an error would have been avoided as only the ID of the bearer and no other extra information exposing millions of sensitive data will have been included for confirmation.

As at the point of notification, we recommended that 1B-50 engage affected digital asset in penetration testing to see how much possibilities an attacker has when they have access to such information. But from our own initial evaluation, possibilities from the end of an attacker is limitless. Actions were taken as advised by Whitehat Nigeria Team.

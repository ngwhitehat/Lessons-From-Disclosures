# 1D-90 SENSITIVE INFO IN IMAGE CAPTURE

We are close to that time of the year when everyone is taking pictures to share on social media of their achievement or an event they attended, this brings us to the story of 1D-90 which happens to be a State Government in Nigeria, who shared on Twitter a few months back the progress she has made on certain project. Few images were shared relating to the project on Twitter, we discovered after reviewing the Tweets (a thread) dated back sometime in 2020, that some of the pictures taken contain sensitive information that may give potential attackers (cyber criminals) an edge to disrupting the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the systems and application on which the project is running.
Referencing the same tweet, our team was able to download and analyse further all the pictures taken in the just commissioned facility, we observed the exposure of sensitive information which include the URL to the said project and some user credentials like that of the administrator.

Sensitive information is highlighted on one of the Images above.

At the point of notification, we recommend that 1D-90 should change the exposed username, as well as restrict access to the platform over the Internet while subsequently, they ensure the photographer team should resist taking pictures in security facilities, and if it becomes so necessary, then let it be taken by security conscious person and be vetted before posting on social platforms
